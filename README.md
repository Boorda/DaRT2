# DaRT

### Description
DaRT is a graphical interface for the BattlEye RCon protocol which can be used for ArmA 2, ArmA 3, and DayZ.

It utilizes the [BattleNET](https://github.com/marceldev89/BattleNET) library by [marceldev89](https://github.com/marceldev89).

DaRT was originally created by [DomiStyle](https://github.com/DomiStyle), some updates made by myself (notably updating the max length of the admin name from 10 characters to 20).

### Notes
There are two main folders, DaRT-Release which just has the most recent release files and is ready to use. And there is the Source-Files folder which has all of the DaRT source files and any edits I have made to them.

Please download DaRT by clicking the code button at the top of this page, then clicking download ZIP. If there are any issues a mirror can be found [here](https://tools.thegamingchief.com/programs/DaRT/).

Feel free to open issues, I might fix major issues, no guarantees though.
